This directory contains the C source for the standard EA IFF reader and
writer modules, and all of the EA examples.  See the LINKER_INFO
directory of this disk for information on which IFF modules must
be linked with each example.

Amiga file I/O can be greatly sped up by use of a RAM buffer. So we now have
a layer of software that provides optional buffering. The "option" is
controlled by changing a "#define" inside the header file GIO.H, adding
GIO.O to your link file, recompiling, and recompiling. When turned off,
this layer becomes just a layer of macro calls between the IFFR and IFFW
modules and the AmigaDOS routines they call.

This RAM buffer speeds things up when you're doing numerous small Writes
and/or Seeks while writing. The general IFF writer IFFW.C tends to do this.
It should be extended to optimize reading, too.

If you are not using IFF, and already Write in chunks of 256 bytes or more,
don't bother using GIO.



*** Commodore-Amiga has modified the SOURCE/showilbm.c to allow it to
be linked with the STANDARD Lstartup.obj found on the Amiga C disk.  If
compiled without using -dTINY, it allows the status information, if any,
to be redirected to the little window that the Lattice startup code
automatically opens in the workbench.   The lines that changed are:

   added a line:

      extern struct WBStartup *WBBenchMsg;

   changed a line:

      from:     wbStartup = (struct WBStartup *)argv;
      to:       wbStartup = WBenchMsg;

   changed references from PrintS to printf throughout.
