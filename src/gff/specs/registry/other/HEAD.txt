FORM
====

FORM ID:  HEAD

FORM Description: 

   FORM HEAD is the file storage format of the Flow idea processor
by New Horizons Software, Inc.  Currently only the TEXT and NEST
chunks are used.  There are plans to incorporate FSCC and some
additional chunks for headers and footers.


CHUNKS
======

CHUNK ID:  NEST

   This chunk consists of only of a word (two byte) value that gives
the new current nesting level of the outline.  The initial nesting level
(outermost level) is zero.  It is necessary to include a NEST chunk only
when the nesting level changes.  Valid changes to the nesting level are
either to decrease the current value by any amount (with a minimum of 0)
or to increase it by one (and not more than one).


CHUNK ID:  TEXT

   This chunk is the actual text of a heading.  Each heading has a TEXT
chunk (even if empty).  The text is not NULL terminated - the chunk
size gives the length of the heading text.


CHUNK ID: FSCC

   This chunk gives the Font/Style/Color changes in the heading from the
most recent TEXT chunk.  It should occur immediately after the TEXT chunk
it modifies.  The format is identical to the FSCC chunk for the IFF
form type 'WORD' (for compatibility), except that only the 'Location'
and 'Style' values are used (i.e., there can be currently only be style
changes in an outline heading).  The structure definition is:

typedef struct {
   UWORD   Location;   /* Char location of change */
   UBYTE   FontNum;    /* Ignored */
   UBYTE   Style;      /* Amiga style bits */
   UBYTE   MiscStyle;  /* Ignored */
   UBYTE   Color;      /* Ignored */
   UWORD   pad;        /* Ignored */
} FSCChange;

   The actual chunk consists of an array of these structures, one entry
for each Style change in the heading text.
