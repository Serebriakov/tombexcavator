A mini duplicate ILBM used for preview (Gary Bonham)

Registered 9/91 by Oxxi's Gary Bonham

PRVW is just like an ILBM but is nested in an ILBM.  It is a
miniature version of the picture.

He didn't call it ILBM because he didn't want editors and parsers
getting confused and delving in.

He didn't use a CAT for obvious reasons (like they blow up DPaint
and nobody can read them).
