Allows to unpack data from PC versions of Bitmap Bros games

unp is windows only: unpacks the .exe files (pklite and others)


dynamite only works with Cygwin, not MinGW!!!

To compile (Cygwin)

configure/make
or just my custom "compile" script (in src): simpler.


For Gods files:

dynamite PLEV1A.DAT LEV1A.DAT

For Cadaver MJM1 files:

dynamite ENG1.LNG ENG1.LNG_unp 4
