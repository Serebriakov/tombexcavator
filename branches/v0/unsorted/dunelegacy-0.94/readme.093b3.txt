Be sure to put the data directory so that the path looks like
gamedir/Release/data

0.93b3:
since there are only some new UI graphics,
you don't have to download the whole package again.
Put the files of data-addon93b3.tar.gz to data/graphics/uigraphics 
and youre done

(if asked you can overwrite the files)
