0.94
Please note that there is a new maintainer of this project now (me, Per Ã˜yvind
Karlsen <peroyvind@sintrax.net>).

Changes for this release:
* Makefile is fixed so things will be built correctly and also you can do
  rebuild without having to rebuild *everything*
* Work on reducing the data size has been started, most bitmaps has been
  converted to png, and wav files to ogg
* Cutscenes has been dropped from the data package for now to reduce space
  used and also playing of those are broken.
* Various minor fixes has been done to the data package, removed redundant
files, unused files, fixed file name casing etc.
* Name of config file has been changed
* New artwork by George/mrfibble has been merged in the data package which
  will give C&C style icons on the sidebar
* get rid of warnings related to no newline at end of file, '/*' inside
  comments, etc..
* fix typo (s/Sardukar/Sardaukar/)
* fix music on non-windows platforms (will also play mp3)
* changed name of binary

TODO:
* Reduce size of data even more:
	o Convert cutscenes to other format to make them a lot smaller
	o Maybe use speex as sound format to reduce file size even more
* Rather use the data extractor to extract most of the data

0.93b3
Updated CVS:
IMPORTANT:
please recognize that you can't use your 0.93b2 savegames anymore
the same will happen with savegames of 0.93b3 and the next version

changes:
new:FogOfWar(80% complete, some bugs left, not all AI affected)
    press f to switch it on and off
new:RepairButton
new:UpgradeBotton (graphical)
new:MessageBar
new: Radarstatic animation if radar turns on or off.

fixed: tech tree issues
fixed: Fast animation of sand from harvester, fast animation while smoking
fixed: Gamespeed is saved in savegames, so old savegames won't work anymore =(
fixed: bug which caused "exit to menu" crashing sometimes
fixed: number of units in build queue now displayed in red or black

discovered bug:
if you play a game with double buffer or fullscreen disabled and then load a savegame (of this game) with double buffer AND fullscreen, your color must no be the right one. (i saved atreides and got harkonnen)
but the radar points have the right color.

Workaround: Play, save and load with same settings of fullscreen and double buffer.

another bug:
prices aren't shown in linux

hint: play in 640x480 and single buffering, higher resolutions are senseless at the moment

TODO:
1.savegames aren't very useful in campaign mode and make problems with fog (turn it on and off once to get rid of  graphical problems)
2.mentat texts have to be completed
3.missions have to be completed
4.map selection screen is missing
