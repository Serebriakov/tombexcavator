Display    v1.06 - 11/88  C. Scheppner   CBM

Requires linkage with standard IFF modules as specified in Display.with.
IFF include files and standard modules are available on the iff disk
(or Fish Disk 64).

NOTE that the a ilbm.h containing CAMG, CRNG, and CCRT definitions
is required.  It is supplied on this disk.  Formerly, these chunks and
the macros for reading and writing them were defined in the application
source or includes.  The new ilbm.h will appear in the next release of
the IFF disk.


This version of Display supports (via command line opt or WB Tooltype)
cycling, timed display, backsreen, and printing.  Printing can also
be started by preesing "p" during a display.  Cycling can be toggled
with TAB.  Exit either by click in upper left, CTRL/C, CTRL/D, or
BREAK if started from a CLI.  CTRL/D will break a script of Displays.
For printing multiple pictures, a script can be set up such as:

   display picture1 opt p t=0
   display picture2 opt p t=0
   etc.

If you wish to run the script while you are working, add the "b"
option.  This will cause the display screen to come up as the backscreen
and not activate its window.
   display picture1 opt bp t=0
