HLID Generic chunk
==================

Chunk ID: "HLID" (HotLink IDentification)
Description:  This chunk is used by applications that store local copies of
HotLink'ed files.  When an application reads in a local copy and finds a HLID
chunk, the application can check if any changes have been made to the file
and get the new changes if any have been made. Also the application can set
up a notification on the file, and treat it just like the application subscribed
to the file. The format of the chunk is 3 long words. The first two hold the
publication ID and the last one holds the publication version number. These
are all the entries needed to load a hotlink'ed file from HotLinks.

Example:
                        HLID            ;chunk ID
                        0000000C        ;chunk length (12 bytes)
                        00000001        ;publication ID (part 1)
                        00000005        ;publication ID (part 2)
                        00000002        ;publication version number
