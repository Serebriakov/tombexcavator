New IFF Chunk ID: "CNAM"

Description:  This chunk would provide names for the colors in a CMAP and CMYK
chunk.  Each CNAM chunk will contains names for a consecutive group of colors.
After the chunk length will be 2 words that identify the starting and ending
color numbers that this CNAM provides names for. Each name will be a NULL
terminated string. There will be (ending-starting)+1 number of NULL terminated
strings in the CNAM chunk.


Example:

        00 FF 00                - color #2 (r=00, g=ff. b=00)
        00 00 FF                - color #3 (r=00, g=00, b=00)
