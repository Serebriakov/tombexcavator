FXHD Chunk
==========

    The required property chunk "FXHD" contains a FaxHeader as defined in
the following header file.  The FaxHeader contains data necessary to interpret
the data chunk "PAGE".  The pixel size of the image can be determined from the
contents of the FaxHeader structure, as well as the dimensions of the source
document.  The compression method used to encode the "PAGE" chunk is also part
of the FaxHeader.

PAGE Chunk
==========

    The required data chunk "PAGE" contains the encoded bit-packed fax image
data that is transmitted/received during phase C of a facsimile communication.
The data always begins with a fax EOL (End of line = 0x001) and ends
with a fax RTC (Return to control = six consecutive EOLs).

    A multiple-page fax can be stored variously as multiple files or, most
preferably, as an IFF LIST object with a shared FXHD chunk.

FLOG Chunk
==========

    The optional data chunk "FLOG" contains log information about a received
fax.  The specification for this chunk will be submitted at a later date.

Note:  You may also find "GPHD" chunks in FAXX files.   This is an
additional header used by one software producer.  See "FAXX.GPHD.doc"
