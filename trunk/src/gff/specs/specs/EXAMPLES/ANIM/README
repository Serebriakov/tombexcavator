These versions of GrabANIM and DisplayANIM have been provided as an example of
ANIM creation and playback.  These programs provide examples of vertical byte
run length compression.  The two routines involved in the compression and
decompression (skip.c and unvscomp.asm) were written by Jim Kent and were
released by him to public domain.  Thanks go to Jim for his contribution
to these programs and to the success of the ANIM format.

The basic IFF read/write code came from the EA IFF routines.  There have been
some modifications made to these routines and these mods have not always 
been in the same vein as the original code.  Most notably, there have been
some global variables added which may render the code non-reentrant.

In the case of DisplayANIM, this version (1.0) does NOT do all the things
that the versions of ShowANIM do.  First of all it will only play
vertical byte style compression.  Second, there is no timing code so
all ANIMs played with this DisplayANIM will just run as fast as possible.
The intent was not to give away the full source to ShowANIM, but to only
provide a working example of ANIM playback.

This sample code compiles under Aztec 3.4.
